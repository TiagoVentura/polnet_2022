## Motivation

--
**Crime and violence have spiked in Latin America's democracies, not only in urban centers but all over the continent.**

-  On average, 20 percent of the population in every Latin American country has been a victim of crime during the past 12 months. 

- Personal security has peaked among citizens' concerns.

--

---
class:middle 

## Motivation

**As violence and insecurity expand, citizens have demanded new and effective approaches to control crime**

- About eight out of ten Latin Americans support harsher punishment of criminals to reduce crime

- Approval rates for the intervention of the armed forces to combat crime sit above 60% for all countries in the region

## Challenges on measuring victimization

Most of the literature in political science focusing on behavioral effects of victimization uses .red[survey measures of individual victimization] or .red[fear of crime]

--

**`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Even in violent democracies, victimization is a rare event.**


--

**`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Victimization is a repeated process (Moncada, 2020)**

--

**`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Victimization is subject to social desirability bias.**

## A Network Approach to Crime Victimization

Given the methodological challenges in the measurement of crime victimization, we develop a novel measure by using respondentsâ€™ information from their friendship network .red[(Zheng et al., 2006; McCormick et al., 2010; McCormick and Zheng, 2013; Calvo and Murillo, 2013)].

--
- Build respondents friendship network using: "How many X's do you know, who also know you and whom you have interacted with in person, by phone, or through some other media in the last year?" 

--

- The X's represent a vector of eighteen indirect items (called Silvia, work as physicians, or work as teachers). 

--

- Within this battery of questions: victims of crime in the last year.

### With this data we measure .red[size], .red[group prevalence] and .red[overdispersion] of our groups in our respondents' friendship network.

class: middle

## Model

--
$$
\begin{equation}
y_{ik} \sim \text{Negative-Binomial}(e^{\alpha_i + \beta_k +\epsilon_{ik}}, \omega_k)
\end{equation}
$$

--

<br><br>

- $\alpha_i$: size of the respondent $i$'s network.

- $\beta_k$: relative prevalence of each group $k$ in the population

- $\omega_k$ controls the overdispersion of the groups $k$. 

--

---
class: middle

### Measuring overdisperson

--

$$
\begin{equation}
r_{ik} = \sqrt{y_{ik}} - \sqrt{e^{\alpha_i + \beta_k}}
\end{equation}
$$
<br><br>

The $r_{ik}$ a higher(lower) residual value indicates that the  respondent is more(less) exposed to criminal violence in their network of friends that expected by our modelling strategy

### Next Steps

- Add more robustness checks for the measure. 

- Gather data from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay (Maybe work on a more methodological piece).

- Expand on differences between crime and police victimization
